# hy360-EVOL_renting
Group project for the course hy360 of UOC - Computer Science Department.
The group consisted of 3 people and used java.swing components for the User Interface.

The topic of the project is the design and implementation of an information system for the electric vehicle rental company EVOL (not a real company).
We must create an application using Java, JDBC and MySQL that allows users to rent vehicles (and by extension to interact with the database).

Install / Run :

We used XAMPP for our database management.
- Run XAMPP with admin rights or the XAMPP control will crash when exiting

Make sure the JAR file (e.g., mysql-connector-java-8.x.x.jar) is in the lib directory of your Java project, or add it to your project's classpath.

For Eclipse IDE :
  Open Eclipse and your project.
  Right-click on your project in the Project Explorer.
  Select "Build Path" and then click on "Configure Build Path."
  Add External JARs:
  
  In the "Properties" dialog, go to the "Libraries" tab.
  Click on the "Add External JARs..." button.
  Navigate to the location where you saved the MySQL Connector/J JAR file, select it, and click "Open."
  Apply Changes:
  
  Click "Apply and Close" to apply the changes to your project's build path.
